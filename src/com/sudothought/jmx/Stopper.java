/**
 * The Stopper class creates an MBeanServerForwarder that can intercept
 * a call to a stop() operation on a "fake" MBean, and stop the connector
 * when that operation is called.
 * Any other called received from the remote side is forwarded to the wrapped
 * MBeanServer.
 * If this forwarder is configured on a JMXConnectorServer, then it will be \
 * possible to stop that JMXConnectorServer remotely using Stopper.stopServer()
 * (see below).
 * The Stopper.stopServer(JMXConnector) method will invoke the stop() operation
 * on the "fake" MBean recognized by the MBeanServerForwarder.
 * <p/>
 * By default the name of the "fake" MBean is:
 * {@code JMImplementation:type=JMXConnectorStopper,name=<instancename>}
 * where {@code <instancename>} defaults to {@code "Stopper"}.
 * <p/>
 * It is possible to specify an alternate value for {@code <instancename>}
 * with the "example.rmi.agent.stopper" system property.
 * The stopper name must be a "shared secret" between the server and the
 * clients that are authorized to stop it.
 * If you started your server using the property
 * example.rmi.agent.stopper=0xf43456ef then you must start your client
 * with the same system property before invoking Stopper.stopServer();
